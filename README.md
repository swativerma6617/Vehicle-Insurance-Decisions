# Vehicle-Insurance-Decisions
Vehicle Insurance Decisions with ETL Pipelines and OLAP Modeling
# Project Overview
This project aims to assist an insurance company in predicting whether its health insurance customers from the past year will also be interested in vehicle insurance. The dataset includes demographics (gender, age, region type) and policy information. By leveraging predictive modeling and data warehousing techniques, the project aims to optimize communication strategies and drive revenue growth.

# Key Objectives
Build a predictive model to identify customers likely to purchase vehicle insurance.
Create an OLTP database using a Star Schema Model with fact and dimension tables.
Utilize cloud databases such as Amazon Redshift and MySQL for data storage and processing.
Design and implement an ETL pipeline using Python and Apache Airflow.
Perform data analysis with SQL queries and visualize insights with tools like Power BI or Tableau.

# Methodology
Data Exploration: Understanding data structure and relationships to address quality issues.
Data Cleaning: Pre-processing data to ensure consistency and relevance.
Data Warehousing: Transfer data to Amazon Redshift, creating a Star Schema for efficient querying.
ETL Pipeline: Automate data workflows using Python and orchestrate with Apache Airflow.
Analysis: Execute SQL queries for insights such as trends, demographics, and policy performance.
Visualization: Create reports and dashboards using Power BI/Tableau for actionable business insights.
